# Modified-RelexNet

This is the project based on RelexNet. There are three models under the file, the modified RelexNet, the modified RelexNet with Negative words and Modifiers, the modified RelexNet without Modifiers.

# Start-up

If you have enough memory (perhaps more than 25gb), you could download the three files and run the file relexnet_classifier.py (the three files all have this .py file)

For me, because of the limit memory size, I used Google Colab pro (could provide 25gb memory) to run the three models. If you use Colab pro, you could run the .ipynb file under each three file. In order to Loading data, you need to first upload the whole project to Google Drive. Then, run .ipynb file, which helps get access to dataset and run the relexnet_classifier.py file.
